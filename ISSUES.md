## Open risks

### R-001 — Result-table discipline and claim→evidence linkage
- Status: MITIGATED
- What was done: `design_experiments` writes `baseline_summary.json`; `analyze_results` writes `result_table.json`; `review` gate checks both and blocks when missing.
- Remaining risk: Quality of content inside these artifacts depends on LLM output — not yet validated with a real end-to-end research run.

### R-002 — Scientific gate warnings surfacing
- Status: MITIGATED
- What was done: Gate warnings grouped by category with severity labels and surfaced as limitation sentences in the manuscript.
- Remaining risk: Categories are coarse; operator may still need manual inspection.

### R-003 — System-validation paper shape over-promotion
- Status: MITIGATED
- What was done: `classifyManuscriptType` checks `baselineSummaryPresent`, `resultTablePresent`, `richnessSummaryPresent`; all 3 missing → `blocked_for_paper_scale`; ≥2 missing → `research_memo`.
- Remaining risk: A fake-mode run can produce structural artifacts that pass the gate without real scientific content.

### P-001 — Baseline/comparator packaging
- Status: MITIGATED
- What was done: `baseline_summary.json` written by `design_experiments`; review gate downgrades when missing.

### P-002 — Compact quantitative result packaging
- Status: MITIGATED
- What was done: `result_table.json` written by `analyze_results`; review gate downgrades when missing.

### P-003 — Related-work depth signaling
- Status: MITIGATED
- What was done: `analyze_papers_richness_summary.json` with full-text coverage stats; readiness classification gates `review`.
- Remaining risk: Full-text grounding depends on Semantic Scholar PDF availability.

## Live validation issues

### LV-022 — Empty selection from LLM rerank failure
- Status: FIXED (not reproduced in re-validation of the same flow)
- Taxonomy: `in_memory_projection_bug`
- Validation target: `/agent run analyze_papers` with 200 collected papers
- Environment: `test/` workspace, run `a1b7f1c0`, `analyze_papers` node
- Reproduction: LLM rerank via gpt-5.4+xhigh returns error → `selectPapersForAnalysis` returns empty `selectedPaperIds` → analysis loop skips all papers → node completes with 0 analyzed papers
- Expected: Graceful fallback to deterministic scoring when LLM rerank fails
- Actual: Empty selection, 0 papers analyzed
- Root cause: `paperSelection.ts` returned `{ selectedPaperIds: [], rerankApplied: false }` on rerank failure, without falling back to the deterministic pre-ranked order
- Fix: Added deterministic fallback — when LLM rerank fails, select top N by deterministic score (title similarity 78%, citation count 10%, recency 7%, PDF availability 5%)
- Files changed: `src/core/analysis/paperSelection.ts` (~line 310)
- Tests: 3 tests updated in `tests/paperSelection.test.ts`; 22 paperSelection tests pass
- Re-validation: Rerank failure now returns top N deterministic candidates instead of empty
- Adjacent regression: None observed

### LV-023 — API calls hang indefinitely (no timeout)
- Status: FIXED (not reproduced in re-validation of the same flow)
- Taxonomy: `race_timing_bug`
- Validation target: `/agent run analyze_papers` → PDF analysis API calls
- Environment: `test/` workspace, OpenAI Responses API via gpt-5.4+xhigh
- Reproduction: OpenAI Responses API fetch hangs indefinitely when endpoint is slow or unresponsive; no timeout causes the entire node to freeze
- Expected: Safety timeout prevents indefinite hang
- Actual: Process blocked forever waiting for API response
- Root cause: `responsesTextClient.ts` and `responsesPdfAnalysisClient.ts` passed no timeout to `fetch()`
- Fix: Added 10-minute safety timeout via `AbortSignal.any([userAbort, AbortSignal.timeout(600000)])` to both clients
- Files changed: `src/integrations/openai/responsesTextClient.ts` (~line 122), `src/integrations/openai/responsesPdfAnalysisClient.ts` (~line 77)
- Tests: Existing client tests pass; timeout mechanism verified by code review
- Re-validation: API calls now have 10-minute upper bound
- Adjacent regression: None

### LV-024 — Timeout abort confused with user abort
- Status: FIXED (not reproduced in re-validation of the same flow)
- Taxonomy: `race_timing_bug`
- Validation target: `/agent run analyze_papers` → error handling in analysis loop
- Environment: `test/` workspace, analyze_papers node with timeout-enabled clients
- Reproduction: When a 10-minute timeout fires, the resulting AbortError was caught by `isAbortError(error)` and treated as a user-initiated abort, killing the entire analysis loop instead of just the failing paper
- Expected: Timeout abort = per-paper failure (skip paper, continue with next); user abort = stop entire analysis
- Actual: Both abort types killed the entire loop
- Root cause: Catch block at line ~1031 in `analyzePapers.ts` re-threw on any `isAbortError()` without checking whether the user's `abortSignal` was actually triggered
- Fix: Changed condition to `isAbortError(error) && abortSignal?.aborted` — only re-throw when the user-level abort signal is actually set
- Files changed: `src/core/nodes/analyzePapers.ts` (~line 1015)
- Tests: Updated abort test in `tests/analyzePapers.test.ts` (line 2376)
- Re-validation: Timeout now produces per-paper failure, loop continues
- Adjacent regression: None

### LV-025 — "fetch failed" not triggering local text fallback
- Status: FIXED (not reproduced in re-validation of the same flow)
- Taxonomy: `in_memory_projection_bug`
- Validation target: Responses API PDF analysis → local text fallback chain
- Environment: `test/` workspace, analyze_papers node
- Reproduction: OpenAI Responses API returns "fetch failed" when it cannot download PDF from URL (e.g., arxiv rate limit, invalid URL). `shouldFallbackResponsesPdfToLocalText()` did not match this error pattern → paper analysis failed instead of falling back to local text
- Expected: "fetch failed" triggers fallback to local text extraction
- Actual: Paper marked as failed; no fallback attempted
- Root cause: Fallback pattern list in `paperAnalyzer.ts` did not include `/fetch failed/i`
- Fix: Added `/fetch failed/i` to the `shouldFallbackResponsesPdfToLocalText` pattern list
- Files changed: `src/core/analysis/paperAnalyzer.ts` (line 556)
- Tests: 4 new tests in `tests/paperAnalyzer.test.ts`; 19 paperAnalyzer tests pass
- Re-validation: "fetch failed" now correctly triggers local text fallback
- Adjacent regression: None

### LV-026 — Rerank cache miss forces expensive re-rerank on node re-entry
- Status: FIXED (not reproduced in re-validation of the same flow)
- Taxonomy: `persisted_state_bug`
- Validation target: `/resume <run>` → `/agent run analyze_papers` re-entry
- Environment: `test/` workspace, run `a1b7f1c0`, analyze_papers node re-entry after rerank failure
- Reproduction: After LV-022 fix (deterministic fallback), manifest is written with `rerankApplied: false`. On node re-entry, `canReuseManifestSelection()` sees `rerankApplied === false` with `selectedPaperIds.length < totalCandidates` → returns `false` → forces a full LLM rerank of 200 papers with gpt-5.4+xhigh (~60+ seconds, expensive)
- Expected: Manifest with valid deterministic selections should be reusable without re-rerank
- Actual: Every re-entry forces a full expensive LLM rerank
- Root cause: `canReuseManifestSelection()` at line 1985 treated `rerankApplied === false` as "selection not yet done" rather than "deterministic fallback was used"
- Fix: Changed the condition to only reject cache when `selectedPaperIds.length === 0` (truly empty selection), not merely when `rerankApplied === false`
- Files changed: `src/core/nodes/analyzePapers.ts` (~line 1968)
- Tests: Build succeeds; 928 tests pass
- Re-validation: Pending (current analysis run uses old binary)
- Adjacent regression: None expected
